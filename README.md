# Sectoral Productivity Losses from Sovereign Default Events: a simulation-based approach

This folder contains files for the replication of my Summer Report. This is a short quantitative project that estimated parameters associated with default cost between sectors (tradable and nontradable GDP) for the typical case of Argentina. I defined tradable GDP as Manufacturing value-added (ISIC divisions 15-37) and nontradable GDP as Services value-added (ISIC divisions 45-99). Data is collected from [World Bank's dataset](https://data.worldbank.org). The report is the file `SummerReport_CarlosRojas.pdf`.

I describe the subfolders:

- üìÅ **Asymmetric Costs**: it contains scripts and functions to estimate the parameters of default cost under the asssumption they differ across sectors. 
- üìÅ **Symmetric Costs**: it contains scripts and functions to estimate the parameters of the default cost under the assumption they are the same in both tradable and nontradable sectors. 

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveat
Construction value-added was not considered because of its non-availability in the dataset. Its inclusion may affect the observation of the sensibility of nontradable GDP to sovereign default events. On the other hand, Construction sectoral dynamics could differ from Services strongly (especially in the aftermath of a sovereign debt crisis), which could be a reason for including that sector as an independent block with its own characteristics (parameters and constraints).       

## üóÇ Files

### Datasets
- `Argentina_DataSet.xlsx`: This file has information on the Argentinean economy, like dates on financial crises, debt to GDP ratio, TFP, investment, net exports, real exchange rate, sovereign spreads, an others. 
- `CountriesDefault.xlsx`: Information of tradable and nontradable GDPs for the following defaulters: 
    -  Argentina, 2002		
    -  Chile, 1983		
    -  Costa Rica, 1981		
    -  Ecuador, 1999		
    -  Grenada, 2004		
    -  Greece, 2012		
    -  Mexico, 1982		
    -  Pakistan, 1999		
    -  Peru, 1984		
    -  Turkey, 2001		
    -  Uruguay, 2003		
    -  Ukraine, 2015

### Scripts and functions
- `CountriesDefault.m`: It replicates Figure 1. To work with this script, you need the function `figureCyc.m`.
- `EmpiricalEvidence.m`: This function estimates the effect of financial crises on Argentinean sectoral GDP. It follows the methodology from Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) which will be used in the Indirect Inference approach. Moreover, it computes main moments for the Simulated Method of Moments, and estimates the Argentinean TFP process by OLS. Finally, it replicates Figure 2. To run this function you need functions `Obstfeld_Gourinchas.m` and `visualize.m` (both functions in folder *Asymmetric Costs*).
