# Sectoral Productivity Losses from Sovereign Default Events: a simulation-based approach

This folder contains files for the replication of my Summer Report. This is a short quantitative project that estimated parameters associated with default cost between sectors (tradable and nontradable GDP) for the typical case of Argentina. 
I defined tradable GDP as Manufacturing value-added (ISIC divisions 15-37), and nontradable GDP as Services value-added (ISIC divisions 45-99). Data is collected from World Bank's dataset. 

### Caveat 
Construction value-added was not taken into account because of its non avalability in the dataset. Its inclusion may affect the observation about the sensibility of nontradable GDP to sovereign default events. On the other hand, Construction sector dynamics could differ from Services strongly, which could be a reason for including that sector as an independent block, with its own characteristics (parameters and constraints).
